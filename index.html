<title>FASTEST CARS IN THE WORLD 1-10</title>
<h1>the Noble M600</h1>
<img src="http://netdna.coolthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/noblem600a.jpg">
<p>Noble is a small company in England with a big horse in the super car race.<br>
   The M600 can muster 225 miles per hour (after hitting 60 in 3.4 seconds),
   thanks to a twin-turbo 4.4 liter V8 that produces 650 horsepower. More
   impressive still is that the engine unit, before Noble gets its hands on it,
    originates from Yamaha, and was originally bred for the Volvo XC90 SUV.
     Tied with the Noble is the Gumpert Apollo, which too can hit a lofty 225
     miles per hour.</p>
     <h1> Pagani Huayra</h1>
     <p>Despite its funny-looking appearance — the gaping form fascia, the
        antennae-like mirrors — everything about the Pagani Huayra was designed
         for speed (and complete luxury). From its AMG-sourced 6.0 liter V12
          (with twin turbos), the Pagani issues 720 horsepower that will help
           it max out at 230 miles per hour.</p>
           <h1>Zenvo ST1</h1>
           <p>Danish boutique super car maker Zenvo is the creator of the ST1,
              a beast of a car that can reach 233 miles per hour thanks to its
               7.0 liter V8 with both a supercharger and a turbocharger. Zero
                to 60 happens in under three seconds; unfortunately, Zenvo built
                 just 15 of these monsters.</p>
                 <h1>McLaren F1</h1>
                 <p>The McLaren F1 is about as legendary as super cars get, and
                    its presence at number six on this list testifies to that.
                     Capable of 240 miles per hour, the F1 is still one of the
                      fastest cars around, despite the fact that its been around
                       since the 1990′s. A 627 horsepower V12 — courtesy of BMW
                        — helps the F1 hit 60 in just 3.2 seconds.</p>
